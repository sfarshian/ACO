# Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a probabilistic technique in computer science and operations research for solving
computational problems that can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs. This algorithm utilizes artificial
ants, representing multi-agent methods inspired by the behavior of real ants. The pheromone-based communication observed
in biological ants is often the predominant paradigm employed.

Combinations of artificial ants and local search algorithms have become a preferred approach for various optimization
tasks involving graphs, such as vehicle routing and internet routing.
